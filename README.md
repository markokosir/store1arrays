## Store 1 - Arrays

This is a compilation of a store programs I wrote for academic purposes using three different data structures from scratch. Store 1 is implemented using arrays. When the program starts it allocates memory on heap and gives 100 possibly 
entries of products.

Files included:
* products.txt - sample database
* codes.txt - codes for products
* main.h & main.c - heart of a program
* product.h & product.c - general functions for working with products
* file.h & file.c - functions for working with files
* utils.h & utils.c - utilities functions

Note: All the code is written in pure C programming language, however header file conio.h is inlcuded in this program(windows.h is also included for rendering reasons), which is not part of ANSI C standard.

Tested/Compiled - Windows XP/Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
