Store 1 - Arrays
=================

This is a compilation of a store programs I wrote for academic purposes in 3 different 
ways or better said data structures from scratch. Store 1 is implemented using arrays. 
When the program starts it allocates memory on heap and gives 100 possibly 
entries of products.

Files included:
-products.txt - sample database
-codes.txt - codes for products
-main.h & main.c - heart of a program
-product.h & product.c - general functions for working with products
-file.h & file.c - functions for working with files
-utils.h & utils.c - utilities functions

Note: All the code is written in pure C programming language, however header file conio.h is 
inlcuded in this program(windows.h is also included for rendering reasons), which is 
not part of ANSI C standard.

This program was made completely and entirely by Marko Kosir, it is freeware,
feel free to use this code or change it in any way you like.
