## Store 1 - Arrays

This is a compilation of a store programs I wrote for academic purposes using three different data structures from scratch. Store 1 is implemented using arrays. When the program starts it allocates memory on heap and gives 100 possibly 
entries of products.

Files included:
* products.txt - sample database
* codes.txt - codes for products
* main.h & main.c - heart of a program
* product.h & product.c - general functions for working with products
* file.h & file.c - functions for working with files
* utils.h & utils.c - utilities functions

Note: All the code is written in pure C programming language, however header file conio.h is inlcuded in this program(windows.h is also included for rendering reasons), which is not part of ANSI C standard.

This program was made entirely by Marko Kosir, it is freeware, feel free to use this code or change it in any way you like. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.

Tested - Windows XP  
Compiled - Microsoft Visual Studio 2005  
MVS 2005 compiler gives you warnings about some of the functions and suggest that you should use ISO C++ functions and replace deprecated ones, if you want feel free to do it.

Upgrade log:  
-ported to MVS 2010  (18.9.2010)
